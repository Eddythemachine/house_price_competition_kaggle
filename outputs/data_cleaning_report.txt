Test Set: 33 columns contained missing values


# Train Set

## 🔢 Treatment of Missing Numerical Values
LotFrontage: Missing values were filled using the mean of the column.

Alley: Dropped due to too many missing values (majority of entries were NaN).

MasVnrType: Initially dropped due to nearly 50% missing values. 
May revisit later for imputation using KNN or advanced modeling.

MasVnrArea: Missing values were replaced with the mean.

BsmtQual: Filled missing entries with the mode (most frequent category).

BsmtCond: Filled missing entries with the mode.

BsmtExposure: Filled missing entries with the mode.

### 🏷️ Categorical Values Handling
Electrical: Missing values were filled with the string "NA" to 
explicitly capture non-recorded cases. This allows the model to consider "NA" as a 
distinct category instead of inferring a relationship that may not exist.

GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual, and GarageCond were also filled with "NA" to 
account for homes with no garage, rather than imputing misleading values.

## 🛠️ Other Considerations
GarageYrBlt: A numerical year field. Missing values were filled with the median to avoid 
skewing by outliers or extreme values.

PoolQC, Fence, and MiscFeature columns were dropped due to excessive missing values and 
lack of predictive power.

Categorical string imputation was preferred in many cases using "NA" or mode to help 
the model capture the absence of a feature (e.g., no basement, no garage) rather than assuming a best guess.
