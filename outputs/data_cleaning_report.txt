## üß™ Train Set Cleaning Steps

### üî¢ Numerical Features

| Feature         | Strategy            | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LotFrontage     | Mean Imputation      | Filled using the mean of the column.                                  |
| MasVnrArea      | Mean Imputation      | Missing values replaced with the mean.                                |
| GarageYrBlt     | Median Imputation    | Median used to reduce the effect of outliers.                         |

### üóÉÔ∏è Categorical Features

| Feature         | Strategy              | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BsmtQual        | Mode Imputation        | Filled with the most frequent value.                                  |
| BsmtCond        | Mode Imputation        | Same approach as above.                                               |
| BsmtExposure    | Mode Imputation        | Ensured consistency with basement-related features.                   |
| Electrical      | Filled with `"NA"`     | Explicitly labeled missing as "NA" to capture non-recorded status.    |
| GarageType      | Filled with `"NA"`     | "NA" indicates no garage present, avoids misrepresentation.           |
| GarageFinish    | Filled with `"NA"`     | Same logic as `GarageType`.                                           |
| GarageQual      | Filled with `"NA"`     | Maintains logical consistency across garage features.                 |
| GarageCond      | Filled with `"NA"`     | Same as above.                                                        |

### üóëÔ∏è Dropped Features

| Feature         | Reason for Dropping                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alley           | Too many missing values; majority of entries were `NaN`.                |
| MasVnrType      | Nearly 50% missing values; dropped for now, may revisit with modeling.  |
| PoolQC          | Excessive missing values; minimal predictive power.                     |
| Fence           | Same as above.                                                          |
| MiscFeature     | Same as above.                                                          |

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Considerations

- For **categorical variables**, missing values were often filled using `"NA"` or the **mode**, based on context:
  - Helps the model distinguish between *absence of a feature* (e.g., no garage) and *missing data*.

- Dropped features were selected based on:
  - High proportion of missing values
  - Lack of clear relationship to the target (`SalePrice`)
  - Minimal contribution to model interpretability
