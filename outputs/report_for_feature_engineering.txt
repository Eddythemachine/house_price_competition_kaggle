Actionable Steps to Reduce Multicollinearity
Drop one of each highly correlated pair:

Remove GarageArea (keep GarageCars).

Remove 1stFlrSF (keep TotalBsmtSF).

Remove TotRmsAbvGrd (keep GrLivArea).

Remove GarageYrBlt (keep YearBuilt).

Keep moderately correlated features if they add unique insights (e.g., FullBath vs. OverallQual).

Verify with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) if building linear models:\

Multicollinearity inflates model variance and misleads interpretation.

Solution: Simplify by keeping one feature from each correlated pair.

Final Feature Recommendations for Modeling:
✅ Keep: OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, TotalBsmtSF, FullBath, YearBuilt
❌ Drop: GarageArea, 1stFlrSF, TotRmsAbvGrd, GarageYrBlt
