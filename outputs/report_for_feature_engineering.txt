Actionable Steps to Reduce Multicollinearity
Drop one of each highly correlated pair:

Remove GarageArea (keep GarageCars).

Remove 1stFlrSF (keep TotalBsmtSF).

Remove TotRmsAbvGrd (keep GrLivArea).

Remove GarageYrBlt (keep YearBuilt).

Keep moderately correlated features if they add unique insights (e.g., FullBath vs. OverallQual).

Verify with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) if building linear models:\

Multicollinearity inflates model variance and misleads interpretation.

Solution: Simplify by keeping one feature from each correlated pair.

Feature Recommendations for Modeling(Categorical Valus):
✅ Keep: OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, TotalBsmtSF, FullBath, YearBuilt
❌ Drop: GarageArea, 1stFlrSF, TotRmsAbvGrd, GarageYrBlt


Imputation Strategy for NaN values: For features like Alley, 
MasVnrType, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, 
BsmtFinType2, FireplaceQu, GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual, 
GarageCond, PoolQC, Fence, and MiscFeature, the "NaN" values represent 
the absence of the feature, which is a meaningful category in itself. 
These should likely be treated as a distinct category 
(e.g., "No Alley", "No Basement") rather than standard imputation.

🧠 Final Feature Engineering Recommendation(Numerical Valuse)
Given the presence of numerous outliers in critical numerical features such as LotArea, 
GrLivArea, and SalePrice, dropping these values would lead to significant data loss and 
potentially distort the underlying distribution of the dataset. Therefore, instead of 
eliminating outliers, we propose a robust transformation strategy that maintains data 
integrity while minimizing the negative impact of extreme values.

Use of RobustScaler for Numerical Features
We recommend applying RobustScaler to all numerical columns during preprocessing. 
Unlike StandardScaler, which uses mean and standard deviation, RobustScaler scales 
data based on the median and interquartile range (IQR), making it highly resistant to outliers. 
This ensures that the overall scale of the features is normalized without allowing extreme values 
to skew the distribution.

Logarithmic Transformation for Highly Skewed Variables
For variables with heavy right-skew, such as SalePrice, LotArea, and GrLivArea, 
we propose using a log transformation (e.g., np.log1p) to compress the range of large values. 
This technique reduces skewness, improves model performance, and helps treat extreme values 
without removing them.

Preservation of Data through Winsorization (Optional)
In cases where numeric values are severely anomalous but still potentially informative, 
Winsorization may be applied. This technique caps values at specified percentiles 
(e.g., 1st and 99th), retaining the row while limiting the influence of outliers.

Categorical Encoding with One-Hot Encoding
One-hot encoding will be applied to all nominal categorical variables. 
While this method does not address outliers directly, it ensures categorical features 
are properly formatted for machine learning algorithms.

Avoid Dropping Outliers to Maintain Dataset Size
Because of the distribution density and potential importance of rare values, 
dropping rows with outliers is not recommended. Our focus remains on retaining as much 
information as possible while dampening the influence of anomalies through scaling and transformation.
