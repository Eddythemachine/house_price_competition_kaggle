## 🗑️ Columns Dropped Due to Excessive Missing Values

The following features were dropped due to a **high proportion of missing values** compared to the dataset size:

| Feature       | Missing Values | Reason for Dropping                                 |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Alley`        | 1369            | Majority missing; presence not impactful            |
| `MasVnrType`   | 872             | ~50% missing; can revisit with modeling later       |
| `FireplaceQu`  | 690             | Categorical; not reliable with so many missing      |
| `PoolQC`       | 1453            | Nearly all missing; no useful variance              |
| `Fence`        | 1179            | Sparsely recorded; unlikely to add signal           |
| `MiscFeature`  | 1406            | Mostly missing; inconsistent, low predictive power  |

## 📈 Correlation Analysis

### 🔗 Strongly Correlated Features (|r| ≥ 0.7)

| Feature 1      | Feature 2      | Correlation (r) | Insight                                     |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `GarageCars`    | `GarageArea`   | 0.88             | Redundant; both measure garage size         |
| `TotalBsmtSF`   | `1stFlrSF`     | 0.82             | Lower floor area overlaps with basement     |
| `GrLivArea`     | `TotRmsAbvGrd` | 0.83             | More rooms generally indicate larger area   |
| `YearBuilt`     | `GarageYrBlt`  | 0.83             | Garage year built aligns with house year    |
| `OverallQual`   | `SalePrice`    | 0.79             | Strong positive relationship                 |

### 🔗 Moderate Correlations (0.5 ≤ |r| < 0.7)

| Feature 1       | Feature 2       | Correlation (r) | Insight                                      |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `FullBath`        | `OverallQual`    | 0.55             | Bathrooms contribute to overall quality       |
| `YearRemodAdd`    | `YearBuilt`      | 0.59             | Remodel year is usually close to build year   |

## 🔍 Multicollinearity Reduction Strategy

To reduce **multicollinearity**, one feature from each highly correlated pair was dropped:

| Drop Feature     | Keep Feature     | Reason                                   |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `GarageArea`      | `GarageCars`     | Better captures usable garage capacity   |
| `1stFlrSF`        | `TotalBsmtSF`    | Basement space overlaps ground floor     |
| `TotRmsAbvGrd`    | `GrLivArea`      | `GrLivArea` is continuous and more robust|
| `GarageYrBlt`     | `YearBuilt`      | Redundant year info                      |

✅ Moderately correlated features were retained to preserve variance and context.

## 🧠 Feature Recommendations for Modeling (Categorical & Numerical)

### ✅ Recommended Features to Keep

- `OverallQual`
- `GrLivArea`
- `GarageCars`
- `TotalBsmtSF`
- `FullBath`
- `YearBuilt`

### ❌ Recommended Features to Drop

- `GarageArea`
- `1stFlrSF`
- `TotRmsAbvGrd`
- `GarageYrBlt`

## 🧩 Imputation Strategy for Categorical NaNs

For features like:

Alley, MasVnrType, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure,
BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinType2, FireplaceQu, GarageType,
GarageFinish, GarageQual, GarageCond, PoolQC, Fence,
MiscFeature


→ Missing values **represent actual absence** (e.g., no garage, no basement) and are best handled by **replacing with meaningful string categories** such as `"No Garage"`, `"No Basement"`.

This avoids misleading imputation and lets the model learn from absence directly.

## 📊 Final Feature Engineering Strategy (Numerical)

### ⚠️ Outliers Present In:
- `LotArea`
- `GrLivArea`
- `SalePrice`

### 🚫 Avoid Dropping Outliers
- Dropping them risks losing valuable patterns.
- Instead, apply robust transformations.

---

### ✅ Recommended Transformations

#### 1. **RobustScaler for Numerical Features**
- Uses **median and IQR**.
- Resistant to outliers.
- Suitable for models sensitive to feature scale.

#### 2. **Log Transform for Skewed Features**
- Apply `np.log1p()` to:
  - `SalePrice`
  - `LotArea`
  - `GrLivArea`
- Helps normalize distributions and stabilize variance.

#### 3. **Optional: Winsorization**
- Cap extreme outliers at 1st and 99th percentiles.
- Keeps rows, reduces outlier influence.

#### 4. **One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features**
- Ensures categorical variables are model-friendly.
- Allows capturing category-level variance.
