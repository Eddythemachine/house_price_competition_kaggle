## ðŸ’¡ 2. Key Insights: Numerical Features vs. Sale Price

- Homes with **higher quality scores**, **larger living areas**, and **added features** 
(e.g., finished basements, modern garages, multiple bathrooms) tend to have **higher sale prices**.

increases.

- Between **$155,000 and $190,000**, there's a notable **jump in luxury amenities** such as:

rise.
