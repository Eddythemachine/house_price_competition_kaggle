## Insights From Numerical vs Target Variable(Price)

Homes with better quality, more space, and more features 
(like finished basements, multiple bathrooms, modern garages, and outdoor amenities) 
are consistently found at higher sale prices.

There's a clear progression from basic to feature-rich homes as sale price increases.

Particularly between 155000 and 190000, there's a sharp increase in luxury 
touches â€” like larger masonry veneer, bigger decks, and more garage space â€” showing 
that premium buyers value comfort and finish just as much as size.
